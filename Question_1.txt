 servers are facing heavy loads recently, and because of the overload, all servers are down.
As head of the server management team, your task is to report to management the optimal way to use the servers and reduce the load.

There are total n servers with m1, m2 .. mn users logged in each of them.

Note: you can only optimize servers individually as different servers belong to different departments, and you can't interchange users in different servers.

Each user uses a particular RAM, and everyone has been assigned a priority number which denotes value added by their task to the project for the current week.

Example:
3 servers:

server 1:
==================================================
10 users:
server capacity: 32 GB

priority number of their task for the coming week:
[10, 15, 10, 9, 2, 3, 3, 11, 25, 7]

RAM usage of thier task(in GB):
[5, 10, 11, 25, 10, 5, 2, 8, 10, 11]

server 2:
==================================================
5 users:
server capacity: 16 GB

priority number of their task for the coming week:
[10, 9, 2, 3, 7]

RAM usage of their task(in GB):
[5, 10, 2, 8, 6]

server 3:
==================================================
10 users:
server capacity: 64 GB

priority number of their task for the coming week:
[1, 5, 7, 8, 2, 3, 3, 10, 5, 7]

RAM usage of thier task(in GB):
[15, 19, 11, 12, 10, 12, 10, 8, 10, 11]

Managers want to know the optimal value that can be added to each project by using the servers to optimal capacity.

Finally, also find out the total value added by all the projects.
Value is the sum of the priority number of users who could complete their tasks for the week.

Your task is following:
Take input from user for number of servers,
Then for each server
Take input from user for number of user,
Take input from user for an array denoting priority number for each user,
Take input from user for an array denoting RAM usage for each user,

Then print value added for each project
Print Total value added by all project for a week.
